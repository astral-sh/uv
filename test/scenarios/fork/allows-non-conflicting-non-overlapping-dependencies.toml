name = "fork-allows-non-conflicting-non-overlapping-dependencies"
description = '''
This test ensures that multiple non-conflicting but also
non-overlapping dependency specifications with the same package name
are allowed and supported.

At time of writing, this provokes a fork in the resolver, but it
arguably shouldn't since the requirements themselves do not conflict
with one another. However, this does impact resolution. Namely, it
leaves the `a>=1` fork free to choose `a==2.0.0` since it behaves as if
the `a<2` constraint doesn't exist.
