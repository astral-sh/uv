name = "fork-marker-limited-inherit"
description = '''
This is like `fork-marker-inherit`, but it tests that dependency
filtering only occurs in the context of a fork.

For example, as in `fork-marker-inherit`, the `c` dependency of
`a<2` should be entirely excluded here since it is possible for
`sys_platform` to be simultaneously equivalent to Darwin and Linux.
However, the unconditional dependency on `b`, which in turn depends on
`c` for Linux only, should still incorporate `c` as the dependency is
not part of any fork.
