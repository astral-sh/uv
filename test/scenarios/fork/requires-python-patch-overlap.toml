description = '''
This tests that a `Requires-Python` specifier that includes a Python
patch version will not result in excluded a dependency specification
with a `python_version == '3.10'` marker.

This is a regression test for the universal resolver where it would
convert a `Requires-Python: >=3.10.1` specifier into a
`python_version >= '3.10.1'` marker expression, which would be
considered disjoint with `python_version == '3.10'`. Thus, the
dependency `a` below was erroneously excluded. It should be included.
