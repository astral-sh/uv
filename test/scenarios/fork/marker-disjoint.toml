name = "fork-marker-disjoint"
description = '''
A basic test that ensures, at least in this one basic case, that forking in
universal resolution happens only when the corresponding marker expressions are
completely disjoint. Here, we provide two completely incompatible dependency
specifications with equivalent markers. Thus, they are trivially not disjoint,
and resolution should fail.

NOTE: This acts a regression test for the initial version of universal
resolution that would fork whenever a package was repeated in the list of
dependency specifications. So previously, this would produce a resolution with
both `1.0.0` and `2.0.0` of `a`. But of course, the correct behavior is to fail
resolving.
