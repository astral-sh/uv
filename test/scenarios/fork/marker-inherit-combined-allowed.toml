name = "fork-marker-inherit-combined-allowed"
description = '''
This test builds on `fork-marker-inherit-combined`. Namely, we add
`or implementation_name == 'pypy'` to the dependency on `c`. While
`sys_platform == 'linux'` cannot be true because of the first fork,
the second fork which includes `b==1.0.0` happens precisely when
`implementation_name == 'pypy'`. So in this case, `c` should be
included.
