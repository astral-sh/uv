name = "fork-marker-inherit"
description = '''
This tests that markers which provoked a fork in the universal resolver
are used to ignore dependencies which cannot possibly be installed by a
resolution produced by that fork.

In this example, the `a<2` dependency is only active on Darwin
platforms. But the `a==1.0.0` distribution has a dependency on `b`
that is only active on Linux, where as `a==2.0.0` does not. Therefore,
when the fork provoked by the `a<2` dependency considers `b`, it should
ignore it because it isn't possible for `sys_platform == 'linux'` and
`sys_platform == 'darwin'` to be simultaneously true.
