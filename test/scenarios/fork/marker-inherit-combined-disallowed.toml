name = "fork-marker-inherit-combined-disallowed"
description = '''
This test builds on `fork-marker-inherit-combined`. Namely, we add
`or implementation_name == 'cpython'` to the dependency on `c`.
While `sys_platform == 'linux'` cannot be true because of the first
fork, the second fork which includes `b==1.0.0` happens precisely
when `implementation_name == 'pypy'`, which is *also* disjoint with
`implementation_name == 'cpython'`. Therefore, `c` should not be
included here.
