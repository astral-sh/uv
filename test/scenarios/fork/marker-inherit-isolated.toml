name = "fork-marker-inherit-isolated"
description = '''
This is like `fork-marker-inherit`, but where both `a>=2` and `a<2`
have a conditional dependency on `b`. For `a>=2`, the conditional
dependency on `b` has overlap with the `a>=2` marker expression, and
thus, `b` should be included *only* in the dependencies for `a==2.0.0`.
As with `fork-marker-inherit`, the `a<2` path should exclude `b==1.0.0`
since their marker expressions are disjoint.
