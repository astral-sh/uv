      markdown_description: |
        You can use uv to install Python dependencies, run scripts, manage virtual environments,
        build and publish packages, and even install Python itself. uv is capable of replacing
        `pip`, `pip-tools`, `pipx`, `poetry`, `pyenv`, `twine`, `virtualenv`, and more.

        uv includes both a pip-compatible CLI (prepend `uv` to a pip command, e.g., `uv pip install ruff`)
        and a first-class project interface (e.g., `uv add ruff`) complete with lockfiles and
        workspace support.
