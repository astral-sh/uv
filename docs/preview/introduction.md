# Introduction

uv is expanding from low-level commands to manage virtual environments and their packages to high-level project management commands and global management of Python installations and command line tools.

See the [project documentation](projects.md) for using uv to manage dependencies in a project, similar to `poetry`.

See the [tool documentation](tools.md) for using uv to run tools in ephemeral environments and install tools, similar to `pipx`.

See the [toolchain documentation](toolchains.md) for using uv to manage Python installations, similar to `pyenv`.
