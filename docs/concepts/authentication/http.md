# HTTP credentials

uv supports credentials over HTTP when querying package registries.

Authentication can come from the following sources, in order of precedence:

- The URL, e.g., `https://<user>:<password>@<hostname>/...`
- A [netrc](#netrc-files) configuration file
- A [keyring provider](#keyring-providers) (off by default)

Authentication may be used for hosts specified in the following contexts:

- `[index]`
- `index-url`
- `extra-index-url`
- `find-links`
- `package @ https://...`

## netrc files

[`.netrc`](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/netrc) files are a long-standing plain text format
for storing credentials on a system.

Reading credentials from `.netrc` files is always enabled. The target file path will be loaded from
the `NETRC` environment variable if defined, falling back to `~/.netrc` if not.

## Keyring providers

A keyring provider typically fetches credentials from an operating system store.

The keyring providers are not used by default.

### The 'subprocess' keyring provider

The 'subprocess' keyring provider invokes the `keyring` command to fetch credentials.

The expected interface for this is based on the popular [keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring)
Python package. Similar support is built-in to pip.

Set `--keyring-provider subprocess`, `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER=subprocess`, or
`tool.uv.keyring-provider = "subprocess"` to use the provider.

### The 'native' keyring provider

!!! note

    The native keyring provider is in [preview](../preview.md) â€” it is still experimental and being
    actively developed.

The native keyring provider uses the secret storage mechanism native to your operating system. On
macOS, it uses the Keychain Services. On Windows, it uses the Windows Credential Manager. On Linux,
it uses the DBus-based Secret Service API.

Currently, uv only searches the native keyring provider for credentials it has added to the secret
store.

Set `--keyring-provider native`, `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER=native`, or
`tool.uv.keyring-provider = "native"` to use the provider.

## Persistence of credentials

If authentication is found for a single index URL or net location (scheme, host, and port), it will
be cached for the duration of the command and used for other queries to that index or net location.
Authentication is not cached across invocations of uv.

When using `uv add`, uv _will not_ persist index credentials to the `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock`.
These files are often included in source control and distributions, so it is generally unsafe to
include credentials in them. However, uv _will_ persist credentials for direct URLs, i.e.,
`package @ https://username:password:example.com/foo.whl`, as there is not currently a way to
otherwise provide those credentials.

If credentials were attached to an index URL during `uv add`, uv may fail to fetch dependencies from
indexes which require authentication on subsequent operations. See the
[index authentication documentation](../indexes.md#authentication) for details on persistent
authentication for indexes.
