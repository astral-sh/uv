## Highlights

- üöÄ A single tool to replace `pip`, `pip-tools`, `pipx`, `poetry`, `pyenv`, `twine`, `virtualenv`,
  and more.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è [10-100x faster](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md) than `pip`.
- üêç [Installs and manages](#python-management) Python versions.
- üõ†Ô∏è [Runs and installs](#tool-management) Python applications.
- ‚ùáÔ∏è [Runs scripts](#script-support), with support for
  [inline dependency metadata](./guides/scripts.md#declaring-script-dependencies).
- üóÇÔ∏è Provides [comprehensive project management](#project-management), with a
  [universal lockfile](./concepts/projects/layout.md#the-lockfile).
- üî© Includes a [pip-compatible interface](#the-pip-interface) for a performance boost with a
  familiar CLI.
- üè¢ Supports Cargo-style [workspaces](./concepts/projects/workspaces.md) for scalable projects.
- üíæ Disk-space efficient, with a [global cache](./concepts/cache.md) for dependency deduplication.
- ‚è¨ Installable without Rust or Python via `curl` or `pip`.
- üñ•Ô∏è Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.

uv is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh), the creators of
[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

## Getting started

Install uv with our official standalone installer:

=== "macOS and Linux"

    ```console
    $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```console
    $ powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

Then, check out the [first steps](./getting-started/first-steps.md) or read on for a brief overview.

!!! tip

    uv may also be installed with pip, Homebrew, and more. See all of the methods on the
    [installation page](./getting-started/installation.md).

## Project management

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```console
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.4

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!
```

See the [project guide](./guides/projects.md) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they're not managed with uv. See the
[publish guide](./guides/publish.md) to learn more.

## Tool management

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```console
$ uvx pycowsay 'hello world!'
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  """

  ------------
< hello world! >
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```console
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.4
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.4
```

See the [tools guide](./guides/tools.md) to get started.

## Python management

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```console
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```console
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using CPython 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python pypy@3.8 -- python
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>>
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```console
$ uv python pin pypy@3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `pypy@3.11`
```

See the [installing Python guide](./guides/install-python.md) to get started.

## Script support

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```console
$ echo 'import requests; print(requests.get("https://astral.sh"))' > example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```console
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
<Response [200]>
```

See the [scripts guide](./guides/scripts.md) to get started.

## The pip interface

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows ‚Äî and experience a 10-100x speedup ‚Äî with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```console
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```console
$ uv venv
Using CPython 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```console
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](./pip/index.md) to get started.
