!!! note

    Other guides, such as migrating from another project management tool, or from pip to `uv pip`
    are not yet available. See [#5200](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5200) to track
    progress.

Or, explore the [integration guides](../integration/index.md) to learn how to use uv with other
