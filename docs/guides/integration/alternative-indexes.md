# Using alternative package indexes

While uv uses the official Python Package Index (PyPI) by default, it also supports
[alternative package indexes](../../configuration/indexes.md). Most alternative indexes require
various forms of authentication, which require some initial setup.

!!! important

    If using the pip interface, please read the documentation
    on [using multiple indexes](../../pip/compatibility.md#packages-that-exist-on-multiple-indexes)
    in uv — the default behavior is different from pip to prevent dependency confusion attacks, but
    this means that uv may not find the versions of a package as you'd expect.

## Azure Artifacts

uv can install packages from
[Azure Artifacts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/start-using-azure-artifacts?view=azure-devops&tabs=nuget%2Cnugetserver),
either by using a
[Personal Access Token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows)
(PAT), or using the [`keyring`](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) package.

To use Azure Artifacts, add the index to your project:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "private-registry"
url = "https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION>/<PROJECT>/_packaging/<FEED>/pypi/simple/"
```

### Authenticate with an Azure access token

If there is a personal access token (PAT) available (e.g.,
[`$(System.AccessToken)` in an Azure pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#systemaccesstoken)),
credentials can be provided via "Basic" HTTP authentication scheme. Include the PAT in the password
field of the URL. A username must be included as well, but can be any string.

For example, with the token stored in the `$AZURE_ARTIFACTS_TOKEN` environment variable, set
credentials for the index with:

```bash
export UV_INDEX_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=dummy
export UV_INDEX_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD="$AZURE_ARTIFACTS_TOKEN"
```

!!! note

    `PRIVATE_REGISTRY` should match the name of the index defined in your `pyproject.toml`.

### Authenticate with `keyring` and `artifacts-keyring`

You can also authenticate to Artifacts using [`keyring`](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) package
with the [`artifacts-keyring` plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/artifacts-keyring). Because these
two packages are required to authenticate to Azure Artifacts, they must be pre-installed from a
source other than Artifacts.

The `artifacts-keyring` plugin wraps the
[Azure Artifacts Credential Provider tool](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider). The
credential provider supports a few different authentication modes including interactive login — see
the [tool's documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider) for information on
configuration.

uv only supports using the `keyring` package in
[subprocess mode](../../reference/settings.md#keyring-provider). The `keyring` executable must be in
the `PATH`, i.e., installed globally or in the active environment. The `keyring` CLI requires a
username in the URL, and it must be `VssSessionToken`.

```bash
# Pre-install keyring and the Artifacts plugin from the public PyPI
uv tool install keyring --with artifacts-keyring

# Enable keyring authentication
export UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER=subprocess

# Set the username for the index
export UV_INDEX_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=VssSessionToken
```

!!! note

    The [`tool.uv.keyring-provider`](../../reference/settings.md#keyring-provider--keyring-provider-)
    setting can be used to enable keyring in your `uv.toml` or `pyproject.toml`.

    Similarly, the username for the index can be added directly to the index URL.

### Publishing packages to Azure Artifacts

If you also want to publish your own packages to Azure Artifacts, you can use `uv publish` as
described in the [Building and publishing guide](../package.md).

First, add a `publish-url` to the index you want to publish packages to. For example:

```toml title="pyproject.toml" hl_lines="4"
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "private-registry"
url = "https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION>/<PROJECT>/_packaging/<FEED>/pypi/simple/"
publish-url = "https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION>/<PROJECT>/_packaging/<FEED>/pypi/upload/"
```

Then, configure credentials (if not using keyring):

```console
$ export UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME=dummy
$ export UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD="$AZURE_ARTIFACTS_TOKEN"
```

And publish the package:

```console
$ uv publish --index private-registry
```

To use `uv publish` without adding the `publish-url` to the project, you can set `UV_PUBLISH_URL`:

```console
$ export UV_PUBLISH_URL=https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION>/<PROJECT>/_packaging/<FEED>/pypi/upload/
$ uv publish
```

Note this method is not preferable because uv cannot check if the package is already published
before uploading artifacts.

## Google Artifact Registry

uv can install packages from
[Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs), either by using an
access token, or using the [`keyring`](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) package.

!!! note

    This guide assumes that [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) CLI is installed and
    authenticated.

To use Google Artifact Registry, add the index to your project:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "private-registry"
url = "https://<REGION>-python.pkg.dev/<PROJECT>/<REPOSITORY>"
```

### Authenticate with a Google access token

Credentials can be provided via "Basic" HTTP authentication scheme. Include access token in the
password field of the URL. Username must be `oauth2accesstoken`, otherwise authentication will fail.

Generate a token with `gcloud`:

```bash
export ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_TOKEN=$(
    gcloud auth application-default print-access-token
)
```

!!! note

    You might need to pass extra parameters to properly generate the token (like `--project`), this
    is a basic example.

Then set credentials for the index with:

```bash
export UV_INDEX_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=oauth2accesstoken
export UV_INDEX_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD="$ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_TOKEN"
```

!!! note

    `PRIVATE_REGISTRY` should match the name of the index defined in your `pyproject.toml`.

### Authenticate with `keyring` and `keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth`

You can also authenticate to Artifact Registry using [`keyring`](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring)
package with the
[`keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth` plugin](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/artifact-registry-python-tools).
Because these two packages are required to authenticate to Artifact Registry, they must be
pre-installed from a source other than Artifact Registry.

The `keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth` plugin wraps
[gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) to generate short-lived access tokens, securely
store them in system keyring, and refresh them when they are expired.

uv only supports using the `keyring` package in
[subprocess mode](../../reference/settings.md#keyring-provider). The `keyring` executable must be in
the `PATH`, i.e., installed globally or in the active environment. The `keyring` CLI requires a
username in the URL and it must be `oauth2accesstoken`.

```bash
# Pre-install keyring and Artifact Registry plugin from the public PyPI
uv tool install keyring --with keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth

# Enable keyring authentication
export UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER=subprocess

# Set the username for the index
export UV_INDEX_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=oauth2accesstoken
```

!!! note

    The [`tool.uv.keyring-provider`](../../reference/settings.md#keyring-provider--keyring-provider-)
    setting can be used to enable keyring in your `uv.toml` or `pyproject.toml`.

    Similarly, the username for the index can be added directly to the index URL.

### Publishing packages to Google Artifact Registry

If you also want to publish your own packages to Google Artifact Registry, you can use `uv publish`
as described in the [Building and publishing guide](../package.md).

First, add a `publish-url` to the index you want to publish packages to. For example:

```toml title="pyproject.toml" hl_lines="4"
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "private-registry"
url = "https://<REGION>-python.pkg.dev/<PROJECT>/<REPOSITORY>"
publish-url = "https://<REGION>-python.pkg.dev/<PROJECT>/<REPOSITORY>"
```

Then, configure credentials (if not using keyring):

```console
$ export UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME=oauth2accesstoken
$ export UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD="$ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_TOKEN"
```

And publish the package:

```console
$ uv publish --index private-registry
```

To use `uv publish` without adding the `publish-url` to the project, you can set `UV_PUBLISH_URL`:

```console
$ export UV_PUBLISH_URL=https://<REGION>-python.pkg.dev/<PROJECT>/<REPOSITORY>
$ uv publish
```

Note this method is not preferable because uv cannot check if the package is already published
before uploading artifacts.

## AWS CodeArtifact

uv can install packages from
[AWS CodeArtifact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-python.html), either by
using an access token, or using the [`keyring`](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) package.

!!! note

    This guide assumes that [`awscli`](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is installed and authenticated.

The index can be declared like so:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "private-registry"
url = "https://<DOMAIN>-<ACCOUNT_ID>.d.codeartifact.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/pypi/<REPOSITORY>/simple/"
```

### Authenticate with an AWS access token

Credentials can be provided via "Basic" HTTP authentication scheme. Include access token in the
password field of the URL. Username must be `aws`, otherwise authentication will fail.

Generate a token with `awscli`:

```bash
export AWS_CODEARTIFACT_TOKEN="$(
    aws codeartifact get-authorization-token \
    --domain <DOMAIN> \
    --domain-owner <ACCOUNT_ID> \
    --query authorizationToken \
    --output text
)"
```

!!! note

    You might need to pass extra parameters to properly generate the token (like `--region`), this
    is a basic example.

Then set credentials for the index with:

```bash
export UV_INDEX_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=aws
export UV_INDEX_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD="$AWS_CODEARTIFACT_TOKEN"
```

!!! note

    `PRIVATE_REGISTRY` should match the name of the index defined in your `pyproject.toml`.

### Authenticate with `keyring` and `keyrings.codeartifact`

You can also authenticate to Artifact Registry using [`keyring`](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring)
package with the [`keyrings.codeartifact` plugin](https://github.com/jmkeyes/keyrings.codeartifact).
Because these two packages are required to authenticate to Artifact Registry, they must be
pre-installed from a source other than Artifact Registry.

The `keyrings.codeartifact` plugin wraps [boto3](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/) to generate
short-lived access tokens, securely store them in system keyring, and refresh them when they are
expired.

uv only supports using the `keyring` package in
[subprocess mode](../../reference/settings.md#keyring-provider). The `keyring` executable must be in
the `PATH`, i.e., installed globally or in the active environment. The `keyring` CLI requires a
username in the URL and it must be `aws`.

```bash
# Pre-install keyring and AWS CodeArtifact plugin from the public PyPI
uv tool install keyring --with keyrings.codeartifact

# Enable keyring authentication
export UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER=subprocess

# Set the username for the index
export UV_INDEX_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=aws
```

!!! note

    The [`tool.uv.keyring-provider`](../../reference/settings.md#keyring-provider--keyring-provider-)
    setting can be used to enable keyring in your `uv.toml` or `pyproject.toml`.

    Similarly, the username for the index can be added directly to the index URL.

### Publishing packages to AWS CodeArtifact

If you also want to publish your own packages to AWS CodeArtifact, you can use `uv publish` as
described in the [Building and publishing guide](../package.md).

First, add a `publish-url` to the index you want to publish packages to. For example:

```toml title="pyproject.toml" hl_lines="4"
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "private-registry"
url = "https://<DOMAIN>-<ACCOUNT_ID>.d.codeartifact.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/pypi/<REPOSITORY>/simple/"
publish-url = "https://<DOMAIN>-<ACCOUNT_ID>.d.codeartifact.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/pypi/<REPOSITORY>/"
```

Then, configure credentials (if not using keyring):

```console
$ export UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME=aws
$ export UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD="$AWS_CODEARTIFACT_TOKEN"
```

And publish the package:

```console
$ uv publish --index private-registry
```

To use `uv publish` without adding the `publish-url` to the project, you can set `UV_PUBLISH_URL`:

```console
$ export UV_PUBLISH_URL=https://<DOMAIN>-<ACCOUNT_ID>.d.codeartifact.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/pypi/<REPOSITORY>/
$ uv publish
```

Note this method is not preferable because uv cannot check if the package is already published
before uploading artifacts.

## Other package indexes

uv is also known to work with JFrog's Artifactory.
