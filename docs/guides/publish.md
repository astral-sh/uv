# Publishing a package

uv supports building Python packages into source and binary distributions via `uv build` and
uploading them to a registry with `uv publish`.

## Preparing your project for packaging

Before attempting to publish your project, you'll want to make sure it's ready to be packaged for
distribution.

If your project does not include a `[build-system]` definition in the `pyproject.toml`, uv will not
build it by default. This means that your project may not be ready for distribution. Read more about
the effect of declaring a build system in the
[project concept](../concepts/projects.md#build-systems) documentation.

## Building your package

Build your package with `uv build`:

```console
$ uv build
```

By default, `uv build` will build the project in the current directory, and place the built
artifacts in a `dist/` subdirectory.

Alternatively, `uv build <SRC>` will build the package in the specified directory, while
`uv build --package <PACKAGE>` will build the specified package within the current workspace.

## Publishing your package

Publish your package with `uv publish`:

```console
$ uv publish
```

Set a PyPI token with `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`, or set a username with `--username` or
`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and password with `--password` or `UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`.

!!! info

    For publishing to PyPI from GitHub Actions, you don't need to set any credentials. Instead,
    [add a trusted publisher to the PyPI project](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/).

!!! note

    PyPI does not support publishing with username and password anymore, instead you need to
    generate a token. Using a token is equivalent to setting `--username __token__` and using the
    token as password.

## Installing your package

Test that the package can be installed and imported with `uv run`:

```console
$ uv run --with <PACKAGE> --no-project -- python -c "import <PACKAGE>"
```

The `--no-project` flag is used to avoid installing the package from your local project directory.

!!! tip

    If you have recently installed the package, you may need to include the
    `--refresh-package <PACKAGE>` option to avoid using a cached version of the package.
