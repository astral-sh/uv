# Getting help

## Help menus

The `--help` flag can be used to view the help menu for a command, e.g., for `uv`:

```console
$ uv --help
```

To view the help menu for a specific command, e.g., for `uv init`:

```console
$ uv init --help
```

When using the `--help` flag, uv displays a condensed help menu. To view a longer help menu for a
command, use `uv help`:

```console
$ uv help
```

To view the long help menu for a specific command, e.g., for `uv init`:

```console
$ uv help init
```

When using the long help menu, uv will attempt to use `less` or `more` to "page" the output so it is
not all displayed at once. To exit the pager, press `q`.

## Viewing the version

When seeking help, it's important to determine the version of uv that you're using â€” sometimes the
problem is already solved in a newer version.

To check the installed version:

```console
$ uv version
```

The following are also valid:

```console
$ uv --version      # Same output as `uv version`
$ uv -V             # Will not include the build commit and date
$ uv pip --version  # Can be used with a subcommand
```

## Open an issue on GitHub

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues) on GitHub is a good place to report bugs
and request features. Make sure to search for similar issues first, as it is common for someone else
to encounter the same problem.

## Chat on Discord

Astral has a [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/astral-sh), which is a great place to ask
questions, learn more about uv, and engage with other community members.
