# Versioning

uv uses a custom versioning scheme in which the minor version number is bumped for breaking changes,
and the patch version number is bumped for bug fixes, enhancements, and other non-breaking changes.

uv does not yet have a stable API; once uv's API is stable (v1.0.0), the versioning scheme will
adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

uv's changelog can be [viewed on GitHub](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
