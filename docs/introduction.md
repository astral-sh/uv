## Highlights

- ‚öñÔ∏è Drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è [10-100x faster](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md) than `pip`
  and `pip-tools` (`pip-compile` and `pip-sync`).
- üíæ Disk-space efficient, with a global cache for dependency deduplication.
- üêç Installable via `curl`, `pip`, `pipx`, etc. uv is a static binary that can be installed
  without Rust or Python.
- üß™ Tested at-scale against the top 10,000 PyPI packages.
- üñ•Ô∏è Support for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- üß∞ Advanced features such as dependency version overrides, multi-platform resolutions, reproducible resolutions,
  alternative resolution strategies, and more.
- ‚ÅâÔ∏è Best-in-class error messages with a conflict-tracking resolver.
- ü§ù Support for a wide range of advanced `pip` features, including editable installs, Git
  dependencies, direct URL dependencies, local dependencies, constraints, source distributions,
  HTML and JSON indexes, and more.

uv is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh), the creators of [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

## Getting started

Install uv with our official standalone installer:

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows.
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Or, see our [installation guide](./installation.md) for more options.

Then, check out our documentation [creating an environment](pip/environments.html).
