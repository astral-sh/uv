# Platform support

uv has Tier 1 support for the following platforms:

- macOS (Apple Silicon)
- macOS (x86_64)
- Linux (x86_64)
- Windows (x86_64)

uv is continuously built, tested, and developed against its Tier 1 platforms. Inspired by the
Rust project, Tier 1 can be thought of as ["guaranteed to work"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rustc/platform-support.html).

uv has Tier 2 support (["guaranteed to build"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rustc/platform-support.html)) for the following platforms:

- Linux (PPC64)
- Linux (PPC64LE)
- Linux (aarch64)
- Linux (armv7)
- Linux (i686)
- Linux (s390x)

uv ships pre-built wheels to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/uv/) for its Tier 1 and
Tier 2 platforms. However, while Tier 2 platforms are continuously built, they are not continuously
tested or developed against, and so stability may vary in practice.

Beyond the Tier 1 and Tier 2 platforms, uv is known to build on i686 Windows, and known _not_
to build on aarch64 Windows, but does not consider either platform to be supported at this time.
The minimum supported Windows version is Windows 10, following [Rust's own Tier 1 support](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/02/26/Windows-7.html).

uv supports and is tested against Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
