## Project metadata
### [`constraint-dependencies`](#constraint-dependencies) {: #constraint-dependencies }

Constraints to apply when resolving the project's dependencies.

Constraints are used to restrict the versions of dependencies that are selected during
resolution.

Including a package as a constraint will _not_ trigger installation of the package on its
own; instead, the package must be requested elsewhere in the project's first-party or
transitive dependencies.

!!! note
    In `uv lock`, `uv sync`, and `uv run`, uv will only read `constraint-dependencies` from
    the `pyproject.toml` at the workspace root, and will ignore any declarations in other
    workspace members or `uv.toml` files.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.uv]
# Ensure that the grpcio version is always less than 1.65, if it's requested by a
# transitive dependency.
constraint-dependencies = ["grpcio<1.65"]
```

---

### [`dev-dependencies`](#dev-dependencies) {: #dev-dependencies }

The project's development dependencies. Development dependencies will be installed by
default in `uv run` and `uv sync`, but will not appear in the project's published metadata.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = ["ruff==0.5.0"]
```

---

### [`environments`](#environments) {: #environments }

A list of supported environments against which to resolve dependencies.

By default, uv will resolve for all possible environments during a `uv lock` operation.
However, you can restrict the set of supported environments to improve performance and avoid
unsatisfiable branches in the solution space.

These environments will also respected when `uv pip compile` is invoked with the
`--universal` flag.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `str | list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.uv]
# Resolve for macOS, but not for Linux or Windows.
environments = ["sys_platform == 'darwin'"]
```

---

### [`index`](#index) {: #index }

The indexes to use when resolving dependencies.

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

Indexes are considered in the order in which they're defined, such that the first-defined
index has the highest priority. Further, the indexes provided by this setting are given
higher priority than any indexes specified via [`index_url`](#index-url) or
[`extra_index_url`](#extra-index-url).

If an index is marked as `explicit = true`, it will be used exclusively for those
dependencies that select it explicitly via `[tool.uv.sources]`, as in:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pytorch"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121"
explicit = true

[tool.uv.sources]
torch = { index = "pytorch" }
```

If an index is marked as `default = true`, it will be moved to the front of the list of
the list of indexes, such that it is given the highest priority when resolving packages.
Additionally, marking an index as default will disable the PyPI default index.

**Default value**: `"[]"`

**Type**: `dict`

**Example usage**:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.uv]
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pytorch"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121"
```

---

### [`managed`](#managed) {: #managed }

Whether the project is managed by uv. If `false`, uv will ignore the project when
`uv run` is invoked.

**Default value**: `true`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.uv]
managed = false
```

---

### [`override-dependencies`](#override-dependencies) {: #override-dependencies }

Overrides to apply when resolving the project's dependencies.

Overrides are used to force selection of a specific version of a package, regardless of the
version requested by any other package, and regardless of whether choosing that version
would typically constitute an invalid resolution.

While constraints are _additive_, in that they're combined with the requirements of the
constituent packages, overrides are _absolute_, in that they completely replace the
requirements of any constituent packages.

Including a package as an override will _not_ trigger installation of the package on its
own; instead, the package must be requested elsewhere in the project's first-party or
transitive dependencies.

!!! note
    In `uv lock`, `uv sync`, and `uv run`, uv will only read `override-dependencies` from
    the `pyproject.toml` at the workspace root, and will ignore any declarations in other
    workspace members or `uv.toml` files.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.uv]
# Always install Werkzeug 2.3.0, regardless of whether transitive dependencies request
# a different version.
override-dependencies = ["werkzeug==2.3.0"]
```

---

### [`package`](#package) {: #package }

Whether the project should be considered a Python package, or a non-package ("virtual")
project.

Packages are built and installed into the virtual environment in editable mode and thus
require a build backend, while virtual projects are _not_ built or installed; instead, only
their dependencies are included in the virtual environment.

Creating a package requires that a `build-system` is present in the `pyproject.toml`, and
that the project adheres to a structure that adheres to the build backend's expectations
(e.g., a `src` layout).

**Default value**: `true`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.uv]
package = false
```

---

### `workspace`

#### [`exclude`](#workspace_exclude) {: #workspace_exclude }
<span id="exclude"></span>

Packages to exclude as workspace members. If a package matches both `members` and
`exclude`, it will be excluded.

Supports both globs and explicit paths.

For more information on the glob syntax, refer to the [`glob` documentation](https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/struct.Pattern.html).

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.uv.workspace]
exclude = ["member1", "path/to/member2", "libs/*"]
```

---

#### [`members`](#workspace_members) {: #workspace_members }
<span id="members"></span>

Packages to include as workspace members.

Supports both globs and explicit paths.

For more information on the glob syntax, refer to the [`glob` documentation](https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/struct.Pattern.html).

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["member1", "path/to/member2", "libs/*"]
```

---

## Configuration
### [`allow-insecure-host`](#allow-insecure-host) {: #allow-insecure-host }

Allow insecure connections to host.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g.,
`localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate
store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it
bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    allow-insecure-host = ["localhost:8080"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    allow-insecure-host = ["localhost:8080"]
    ```

---

### [`cache-dir`](#cache-dir) {: #cache-dir }

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$HOME/Library/Caches/uv` on macOS, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on
Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    cache-dir = "./.uv_cache"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    cache-dir = "./.uv_cache"
    ```

---

### [`cache-keys`](#cache-keys) {: #cache-keys }

The keys to consider when caching builds for the project.

Cache keys enable you to specify the files or directories that should trigger a rebuild when
modified. By default, uv will rebuild a project whenever the `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`,
or `setup.cfg` files in the project directory are modified, i.e.:

```toml
cache-keys = [{ file = "pyproject.toml" }, { file = "setup.py" }, { file = "setup.cfg" }]
```

As an example: if a project uses dynamic metadata to read its dependencies from a
`requirements.txt` file, you can specify `cache-keys = [{ file = "requirements.txt" }, { file = "pyproject.toml" }]`
to ensure that the project is rebuilt whenever the `requirements.txt` file is modified (in
addition to watching the `pyproject.toml`).

Globs are supported, following the syntax of the [`glob`](https://docs.rs/glob/0.3.1/glob/struct.Pattern.html)
crate. For example, to invalidate the cache whenever a `.toml` file in the project directory
or any of its subdirectories is modified, you can specify `cache-keys = [{ file = "**/*.toml" }]`.
Note that the use of globs can be expensive, as uv may need to walk the filesystem to
determine whether any files have changed.

Cache keys can also include version control information. For example, if a project uses
`setuptools_scm` to read its version from a Git tag, you can specify `cache-keys = [{ git = true }, { file = "pyproject.toml" }]`
to include the current Git commit hash in the cache key (in addition to the
`pyproject.toml`).

Cache keys only affect the project defined by the `pyproject.toml` in which they're
specified (as opposed to, e.g., affecting all members in a workspace), and all paths and
globs are interpreted as relative to the project directory.

**Default value**: `[{ file = "pyproject.toml" }, { file = "setup.py" }, { file = "setup.cfg" }]`

**Type**: `list[dict]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    cache-keys = [{ file = "pyproject.toml" }, { file = "requirements.txt" }, { git = true }]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    cache-keys = [{ file = "pyproject.toml" }, { file = "requirements.txt" }, { git = true }]
    ```

---

### [`compile-bytecode`](#compile-bytecode) {: #compile-bytecode }

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`);
instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases
in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option
can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that
are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also
ignore errors.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    compile-bytecode = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    compile-bytecode = true
    ```

---

### [`concurrent-builds`](#concurrent-builds) {: #concurrent-builds }

The maximum number of source distributions that uv will build concurrently at any given
time.

Defaults to the number of available CPU cores.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `int`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    concurrent-builds = 4
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    concurrent-builds = 4
    ```

---

### [`concurrent-downloads`](#concurrent-downloads) {: #concurrent-downloads }

The maximum number of in-flight concurrent downloads that uv will perform at any given
time.

**Default value**: `50`

**Type**: `int`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    concurrent-downloads = 4
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    concurrent-downloads = 4
    ```

---

### [`concurrent-installs`](#concurrent-installs) {: #concurrent-installs }

The number of threads used when installing and unzipping packages.

Defaults to the number of available CPU cores.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `int`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    concurrent-installs = 4
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    concurrent-installs = 4
    ```

---

### [`config-settings`](#config-settings) {: #config-settings }

Settings to pass to the [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) build backend,
specified as `KEY=VALUE` pairs.

**Default value**: `{}`

**Type**: `dict`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    config-settings = { editable_mode = "compat" }
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    config-settings = { editable_mode = "compat" }
    ```

---

### [`dependency-metadata`](#dependency-metadata) {: #dependency-metadata }

Pre-defined static metadata for dependencies of the project (direct or transitive). When
provided, enables the resolver to use the specified metadata instead of querying the
registry or building the relevant package from source.

Metadata should be provided in adherence with the [Metadata 2.3](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/)
standard, though only the following fields are respected:

- `name`: The name of the package.
- (Optional) `version`: The version of the package. If omitted, the metadata will be applied
  to all versions of the package.
- (Optional) `requires-dist`: The dependencies of the package (e.g., `werkzeug>=0.14`).
- (Optional) `requires-python`: The Python version required by the package (e.g., `>=3.10`).
- (Optional) `provides-extras`: The extras provided by the package.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[dict]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    dependency-metadata = [
        { name = "flask", version = "1.0.0", requires-dist = ["werkzeug"], requires-python = ">=3.6" },
    ]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    dependency-metadata = [
        { name = "flask", version = "1.0.0", requires-dist = ["werkzeug"], requires-python = ">=3.6" },
    ]
    ```

---

### [`exclude-newer`](#exclude-newer) {: #exclude-newer }

Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html) timestamps (e.g.,
`2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your
system's configured time zone.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    exclude-newer = "2006-12-02"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    exclude-newer = "2006-12-02"
    ```

---

### [`extra-index-url`](#extra-index-url) {: #extra-index-url }

Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by
[`index_url`](#index-url) or [`index`](#index) with `default = true`. When multiple indexes
are provided, earlier values take priority.

To control uv's resolution strategy when multiple indexes are present, see
[`index_strategy`](#index-strategy).

(Deprecated: use `index` instead.)

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    extra-index-url = ["https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    extra-index-url = ["https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu"]
    ```

---

### [`find-links`](#find-links) {: #find-links }

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry
indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or
source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the
formats described above.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    find-links = ["https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    find-links = ["https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html"]
    ```

---

### [`index`](#index) {: #index }

The package indexes to use when resolving dependencies.

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

Indexes are considered in the order in which they're defined, such that the first-defined
index has the highest priority.

If an index is marked as `explicit = true`, it will be used exclusively for those
dependencies that select it explicitly via `[tool.uv.sources]`, as in:

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pytorch"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121"
explicit = true

[tool.uv.sources]
torch = { index = "pytorch" }
```

Marking an index as `default = true` will disable the PyPI default index and move the
index to the end of the prioritized list, such that it is used when a package is not found
on any other index.

**Default value**: `"[]"`

**Type**: `dict`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    [[tool.uv.index]]
    name = "pytorch"
    url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    [[tool.uv.index]]
    name = "pytorch"
    url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121"
    ```

---

### [`index-strategy`](#index-strategy) {: #index-strategy }

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and
limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-match`). This prevents
"dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the
same name to an alternate index.

**Default value**: `"first-index"`

**Possible values**:

- `"first-index"`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `"unsafe-first-match"`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `"unsafe-best-match"`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    index-strategy = "unsafe-best-match"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    index-strategy = "unsafe-best-match"
    ```

---

### [`index-url`](#index-url) {: #index-url }

The URL of the Python package index (by default: <https://pypi.org/simple>).

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index provided by this setting is given lower priority than any indexes specified via
[`extra_index_url`](#extra-index-url) or [`index`](#index).

(Deprecated: use `index` instead.)

**Default value**: `"https://pypi.org/simple"`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    index-url = "https://test.pypi.org/simple"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    index-url = "https://test.pypi.org/simple"
    ```

---

### [`keyring-provider`](#keyring-provider) {: #keyring-provider }

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to
use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

**Default value**: `"disabled"`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    keyring-provider = "subprocess"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    keyring-provider = "subprocess"
    ```

---

### [`link-mode`](#link-mode) {: #link-mode }

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and
Windows.

**Default value**: `"clone" (macOS) or "hardlink" (Linux, Windows)`

**Possible values**:

- `"clone"`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `"copy"`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `"hardlink"`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `"symlink"`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    link-mode = "copy"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    link-mode = "copy"
    ```

---

### [`native-tls`](#native-tls) {: #native-tls }

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The
`webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv
improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store,
especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's
included in your system's certificate store.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    native-tls = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    native-tls = true
    ```

---

### [`no-binary`](#no-binary) {: #no-binary }

Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use
pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    no-binary = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    no-binary = true
    ```

---

### [`no-binary-package`](#no-binary-package) {: #no-binary-package }

Don't install pre-built wheels for a specific package.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    no-binary-package = ["ruff"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    no-binary-package = ["ruff"]
    ```

---

### [`no-build`](#no-build) {: #no-build }

Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of
already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building
distributions will exit with an error.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    no-build = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    no-build = true
    ```

---

### [`no-build-isolation`](#no-build-isolation) {: #no-build-isolation }

Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/)
are already installed.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    no-build-isolation = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    no-build-isolation = true
    ```

---

### [`no-build-isolation-package`](#no-build-isolation-package) {: #no-build-isolation-package }

Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.

Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/)
are already installed.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `Vec<PackageName>`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    no-build-isolation-package = ["package1", "package2"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    no-build-isolation-package = ["package1", "package2"]
    ```

---

### [`no-build-package`](#no-build-package) {: #no-build-package }

Don't build source distributions for a specific package.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    [tool.uv]
    no-build-package = ["ruff"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    no-build-package = ["ruff"]
    ```

---

### [`no-cache`](#no-cache) {: #no-cache }

Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the
duration of the operation.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv]
    no-cache = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    
    no-cache = true
    ```

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    all-extras = true
    ```

    ```

---

#### [`allow-empty-requirements`](#pip_allow-empty-requirements) {: #pip_allow-empty-requirements }
<span id="allow-empty-requirements"></span>

Allow `uv pip sync` with empty requirements, which will clear the environment of all
packages.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    allow-empty-requirements = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml

    allow-empty-requirements = true
    ```

---

#### [`allow-insecure-host`](#pip_allow-insecure-host) {: #pip_allow-insecure-host }
<span id="allow-insecure-host"></span>

Allow insecure connections to host.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g.,
`localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate
store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it
bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    allow-insecure-host = ["localhost:8080"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    allow-insecure-host = ["localhost:8080"]
    ```

---

- `"split"`: Render each annotation on its own line

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    annotation-style = "line"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]

    ```

---

#### [`break-system-packages`](#pip_break-system-packages) {: #pip_break-system-packages }
<span id="break-system-packages"></span>

Allow uv to modify an `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` Python installation.

WARNING: `--break-system-packages` is intended for use in continuous integration (CI)
environments, when installing into Python installations that are managed by an external
package manager, like `apt`. It should be used with caution, as such Python installations
explicitly recommend against modifications by other package managers (like uv or pip).

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    break-system-packages = true
    ```

    ```

---

#### [`compile-bytecode`](#pip_compile-bytecode) {: #pip_compile-bytecode }
<span id="compile-bytecode"></span>

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`);
instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases
in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option
can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that
are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also
ignore errors.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    compile-bytecode = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    compile-bytecode = true
    ```

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    config-settings = { editable_mode = "compat" }
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    config-settings = { editable_mode = "compat" }
    ```

---

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    custom-compile-command = "./custom-uv-compile.sh"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    custom-compile-command = "./custom-uv-compile.sh"
    ```

---

#### [`dependency-metadata`](#pip_dependency-metadata) {: #pip_dependency-metadata }
<span id="dependency-metadata"></span>

Pre-defined static metadata for dependencies of the project (direct or transitive). When
provided, enables the resolver to use the specified metadata instead of querying the
registry or building the relevant package from source.

Metadata should be provided in adherence with the [Metadata 2.3](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/)
standard, though only the following fields are respected:

- `name`: The name of the package.

  to all versions of the package.
- (Optional) `requires-dist`: The dependencies of the package (e.g., `werkzeug>=0.14`).
- (Optional) `requires-python`: The Python version required by the package (e.g., `>=3.10`).
- (Optional) `provides-extras`: The extras provided by the package.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[dict]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

dependencies is valid.

The pinned dependencies may be valid even when the marker expression is
false, but when the expression is true, the requirements are known to
be correct.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    emit-marker-expression = true
    ```

    ```

---

#### [`extra-index-url`](#pip_extra-index-url) {: #pip_extra-index-url }
<span id="extra-index-url"></span>

Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by
[`index_url`](#index-url). When multiple indexes are provided, earlier values take priority.

To control uv's resolution strategy when multiple indexes are present, see
[`index_strategy`](#index-strategy).

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    extra-index-url = ["https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu"]
    ```

---

#### [`find-links`](#pip_find-links) {: #pip_find-links }
<span id="find-links"></span>

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry
indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or

    ```

---

#### [`index-strategy`](#pip_index-strategy) {: #pip_index-strategy }
<span id="index-strategy"></span>

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and
limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-match`). This prevents
"dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the
same name to an alternate index.

**Default value**: `"first-index"`

**Possible values**:

- `"first-index"`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `"unsafe-first-match"`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `"unsafe-best-match"`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    index-strategy = "unsafe-best-match"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    index-strategy = "unsafe-best-match"
    ```

---

#### [`index-url`](#pip_index-url) {: #pip_index-url }
<span id="index-url"></span>

The URL of the Python package index (by default: <https://pypi.org/simple>).

Accepts either a repository compliant with [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
(the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index provided by this setting is given lower priority than any indexes specified via
[`extra_index_url`](#extra-index-url).

**Default value**: `"https://pypi.org/simple"`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    index-url = "https://test.pypi.org/simple"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    index-url = "https://test.pypi.org/simple"
    ```

---

#### [`keyring-provider`](#pip_keyring-provider) {: #pip_keyring-provider }
<span id="keyring-provider"></span>

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    keyring-provider = "subprocess"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-annotate = true
    ```

#### [`no-binary`](#pip_no-binary) {: #pip_no-binary }
<span id="no-binary"></span>

Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use
pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with `:all:`.
Clear previously specified packages with `:none:`.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-binary = ["ruff"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-binary = ["ruff"]
    ```

---

#### [`no-build`](#pip_no-build) {: #pip_no-build }
<span id="no-build"></span>

Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of
already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building
distributions will exit with an error.

Alias for `--only-binary :all:`.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-build = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-build = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-build-isolation`](#pip_no-build-isolation) {: #pip_no-build-isolation }
<span id="no-build-isolation"></span>

Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/)
are already installed.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-build-isolation = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-build-isolation = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-build-isolation-package`](#pip_no-build-isolation-package) {: #pip_no-build-isolation-package }
<span id="no-build-isolation-package"></span>

Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.

Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/)
are already installed.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `Vec<PackageName>`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-build-isolation-package = ["package1", "package2"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-build-isolation-package = ["package1", "package2"]
    ```

---

#### [`no-deps`](#pip_no-deps) {: #pip_no-deps }
<span id="no-deps"></span>

Ignore package dependencies, instead only add those packages explicitly listed
on the command line to the resulting the requirements file.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-deps = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-deps = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-emit-package`](#pip_no-emit-package) {: #pip_no-emit-package }
<span id="no-emit-package"></span>

Specify a package to omit from the output resolution. Its dependencies will still be
included in the resolution. Equivalent to pip-compile's `--unsafe-package` option.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-emit-package = ["ruff"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-emit-package = ["ruff"]
    ```

---

#### [`no-header`](#pip_no-header) {: #pip_no-header }
<span id="no-header"></span>

Exclude the comment header at the top of output file generated by `uv pip compile`.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-header = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-header = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-index`](#pip_no-index) {: #pip_no-index }
<span id="no-index"></span>

Ignore all registry indexes (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and
those provided via `--find-links`.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-index = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-index = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-sources`](#pip_no-sources) {: #pip_no-sources }
<span id="no-sources"></span>

Ignore the `tool.uv.sources` table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the
standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any local or Git
sources.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-sources = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-sources = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-strip-extras`](#pip_no-strip-extras) {: #pip_no-strip-extras }
<span id="no-strip-extras"></span>

Include extras in the output file.

By default, uv strips extras, as any packages pulled in by the extras are already included
as dependencies in the output file directly. Further, output files generated with
`--no-strip-extras` cannot be used as constraints files in `install` and `sync` invocations.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-strip-extras = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-strip-extras = true
    ```

---

#### [`no-strip-markers`](#pip_no-strip-markers) {: #pip_no-strip-markers }
<span id="no-strip-markers"></span>

Include environment markers in the output file generated by `uv pip compile`.

By default, uv strips environment markers, as the resolution generated by `compile` is
only guaranteed to be correct for the target environment.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    no-strip-markers = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    no-strip-markers = true
    ```

---

#### [`only-binary`](#pip_only-binary) {: #pip_only-binary }
<span id="only-binary"></span>

Only use pre-built wheels; don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run code from the given packages. The cached wheels of already-built
source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will
exit with an error.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with `:all:`.
Clear previously specified packages with `:none:`.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    only-binary = ["ruff"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    only-binary = ["ruff"]
    ```

---

#### [`output-file`](#pip_output-file) {: #pip_output-file }
<span id="output-file"></span>

Write the requirements generated by `uv pip compile` to the given `requirements.txt` file.

If the file already exists, the existing versions will be preferred when resolving
dependencies, unless `--upgrade` is also specified.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    output-file = "requirements.txt"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    output-file = "requirements.txt"
    ```

---

#### [`prefix`](#pip_prefix) {: #pip_prefix }
<span id="prefix"></span>

Install packages into `lib`, `bin`, and other top-level folders under the specified
directory, as if a virtual environment were present at that location.

In general, prefer the use of `--python` to install into an alternate environment, as
scripts and other artifacts installed via `--prefix` will reference the installing
interpreter, rather than any interpreter added to the `--prefix` directory, rendering them
non-portable.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    prefix = "./prefix"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    prefix = "./prefix"
    ```

---

#### [`prerelease`](#pip_prerelease) {: #pip_prerelease }
<span id="prerelease"></span>

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases,
along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the
declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

**Default value**: `"if-necessary-or-explicit"`

**Possible values**:

- `"disallow"`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `"allow"`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `"if-necessary"`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `"explicit"`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
- `"if-necessary-or-explicit"`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    prerelease = "allow"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    prerelease = "allow"
    ```

---

#### [`python`](#pip_python) {: #pip_python }
<span id="python"></span>

The Python interpreter into which packages should be installed.

By default, uv installs into the virtual environment in the current working directory or
any parent directory. The `--python` option allows you to specify a different interpreter,
which is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments or other automated
workflows.

Supported formats:
- `3.10` looks for an installed Python 3.10 in the registry on Windows (see
  `py --list-paths`), or `python3.10` on Linux and macOS.
- `python3.10` or `python.exe` looks for a binary with the given name in `PATH`.
- `/home/ferris/.local/bin/python3.10` uses the exact Python at the given path.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    python = "3.10"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    python = "3.10"
    ```

---

#### [`python-platform`](#pip_python-platform) {: #pip_python-platform }
<span id="python-platform"></span>

The platform for which requirements should be resolved.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of
its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or
`aarch64-apple-darwin`.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    python-platform = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    python-platform = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
    ```

---

#### [`python-version`](#pip_python-version) {: #pip_python-version }
<span id="python-version"></span>

The minimum Python version that should be supported by the resolved requirements (e.g.,
`3.8` or `3.8.17`).

If a patch version is omitted, the minimum patch version is assumed. For example, `3.8` is
mapped to `3.8.0`.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    python-version = "3.8"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    python-version = "3.8"
    ```

---

#### [`reinstall`](#pip_reinstall) {: #pip_reinstall }
<span id="reinstall"></span>

Reinstall all packages, regardless of whether they're already installed. Implies `refresh`.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    reinstall = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    reinstall = true
    ```

---

#### [`reinstall-package`](#pip_reinstall-package) {: #pip_reinstall-package }
<span id="reinstall-package"></span>

Reinstall a specific package, regardless of whether it's already installed. Implies
`refresh-package`.

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    reinstall-package = ["ruff"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    reinstall-package = ["ruff"]
    ```

---

#### [`require-hashes`](#pip_require-hashes) {: #pip_require-hashes }
<span id="require-hashes"></span>

Require a matching hash for each requirement.

Hash-checking mode is all or nothing. If enabled, _all_ requirements must be provided
with a corresponding hash or set of hashes. Additionally, if enabled, _all_ requirements
must either be pinned to exact versions (e.g., `==1.0.0`), or be specified via direct URL.

Hash-checking mode introduces a number of additional constraints:

- Git dependencies are not supported.
- Editable installs are not supported.
- Local dependencies are not supported, unless they point to a specific wheel (`.whl`) or
  source archive (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`), as opposed to a directory.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    require-hashes = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    require-hashes = true
    ```

---

#### [`resolution`](#pip_resolution) {: #pip_resolution }
<span id="resolution"></span>

The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given
package requirement.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (`highest`).

**Default value**: `"highest"`

**Possible values**:

- `"highest"`: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
- `"lowest"`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
- `"lowest-direct"`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    resolution = "lowest-direct"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    resolution = "lowest-direct"
    ```

---

#### [`strict`](#pip_strict) {: #pip_strict }
<span id="strict"></span>

Validate the Python environment, to detect packages with missing dependencies and other
issues.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    strict = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    strict = true
    ```

---

#### [`system`](#pip_system) {: #pip_system }
<span id="system"></span>

Install packages into the system Python environment.

By default, uv installs into the virtual environment in the current working directory or
any parent directory. The `--system` option instructs uv to instead use the first Python
found in the system `PATH`.

WARNING: `--system` is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments and
should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    system = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    system = true
    ```

---

#### [`target`](#pip_target) {: #pip_target }
<span id="target"></span>

Install packages into the specified directory, rather than into the virtual or system Python
environment. The packages will be installed at the top-level of the directory.

**Default value**: `None`

**Type**: `str`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    target = "./target"
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    target = "./target"
    ```

---

#### [`universal`](#pip_universal) {: #pip_universal }
<span id="universal"></span>

Perform a universal resolution, attempting to generate a single `requirements.txt` output
file that is compatible with all operating systems, architectures, and Python
implementations.

In universal mode, the current Python version (or user-provided `--python-version`) will be
treated as a lower bound. For example, `--universal --python-version 3.7` would produce a
universal resolution for Python 3.7 and later.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    universal = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    universal = true
    ```

---

#### [`upgrade`](#pip_upgrade) {: #pip_upgrade }
<span id="upgrade"></span>

Allow package upgrades, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    upgrade = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    upgrade = true
    ```

---

#### [`upgrade-package`](#pip_upgrade-package) {: #pip_upgrade-package }
<span id="upgrade-package"></span>

Allow upgrades for a specific package, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output
file.

Accepts both standalone package names (`ruff`) and version specifiers (`ruff<0.5.0`).

**Default value**: `[]`

**Type**: `list[str]`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    upgrade-package = ["ruff"]
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    upgrade-package = ["ruff"]
    ```

---

#### [`verify-hashes`](#pip_verify-hashes) {: #pip_verify-hashes }
<span id="verify-hashes"></span>

Validate any hashes provided in the requirements file.

Unlike `--require-hashes`, `--verify-hashes` does not require that all requirements have
hashes; instead, it will limit itself to verifying the hashes of those requirements that do
include them.

**Default value**: `false`

**Type**: `bool`

**Example usage**:

=== "pyproject.toml"

    ```toml
    [tool.uv.pip]
    verify-hashes = true
    ```
=== "uv.toml"

    ```toml
    [pip]
    verify-hashes = true
    ```
