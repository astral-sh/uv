### `UV_SKIP_WHEEL_FILENAME_CHECK`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.8.23`</small>

(4194304) stack. `UV_STACK_SIZE` takes precedence over `RUST_MIN_STACK`.

Unlike the normal `RUST_MIN_STACK` semantics, this can affect main thread
stack size, because we actually spawn our own main2 thread to work around
the fact that Windows' real main thread is only 1MB. That thread has size
`max(UV_STACK_SIZE, 1MB)`.

Specifies the directory where uv stores pyx credentials.

### `RUST_BACKTRACE`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.7.22`</small>

If set, it can be used to display more stack trace details when a panic occurs.
This is used by uv particularly on windows to show more details during a platform exception.

For example:

* `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` will print a short backtrace.
* `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` will print a full backtrace.

See the [Rust backtrace documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/backtrace/index.html)
for more.

### `RUST_LOG`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.0.5`</small>

If set, uv will use this value as the log level for its `--verbose` output. Accepts
any filter compatible with the `tracing_subscriber` crate.

For example:

* `RUST_LOG=uv=debug` is the equivalent of adding `--verbose` to the command line
* `RUST_LOG=trace` will enable trace-level logging.

See the [tracing documentation](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#example-syntax)
for more.

### `RUST_MIN_STACK`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.5.19`</small>

Use to set the stack size used by uv.

The value is in bytes, and if both `UV_STACK_SIZE` are `RUST_MIN_STACK` unset, uv uses a 4MB
(4194304) stack. `UV_STACK_SIZE` takes precedence over `RUST_MIN_STACK`.

Prefer setting `UV_STACK_SIZE`, since `RUST_MIN_STACK` also affects subprocesses, such as
build backends that use Rust code.

Unlike the normal `RUST_MIN_STACK` semantics, this can affect main thread
stack size, because we actually spawn our own main2 thread to work around
the fact that Windows' real main thread is only 1MB. That thread has size
`max(RUST_MIN_STACK, 1MB)`.

### `SHELL`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.1.16`</small>

The standard `SHELL` posix env var.

### `SSL_CERT_FILE`

### `SSL_CLIENT_CERT`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.2.11`</small>

This should be a single file containing both the certificate and the private key in PEM format.

### `SYSTEMDRIVE`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.4.26`</small>

Path to system-level configuration directory on Windows systems.

### `TRACING_DURATIONS_FILE`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.0.5`</small>

Use to create the tracing durations file via the `tracing-durations-export` feature.

### `USERPROFILE`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.0.5`</small>

Path to root directory of user's profile on Windows systems.

### `UV`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.6.0`</small>

The path to the binary that was used to invoke uv.

This is propagated to all subprocesses spawned by uv.

If the executable was invoked through a symbolic link, some platforms will return the path
of the symbolic link and other platforms will return the path of the symbolic link’s target.

See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.current_exe.html#security> for security
considerations.

### `VIRTUAL_ENV`
<small class="added-in">added in `0.0.5`</small>

Used to detect an activated virtual environment.

### `VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT`

virtual environment name will not be prepended to the terminal prompt.
