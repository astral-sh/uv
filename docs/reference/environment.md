(4194304) stack. `UV_STACK_SIZE` takes precedence over `RUST_MIN_STACK`.

Unlike the normal `RUST_MIN_STACK` semantics, this can affect main thread
stack size, because we actually spawn our own main2 thread to work around

### `RUST_BACKTRACE`

If set, it can be used to display more stack trace details when a panic occurs.
This is used by uv particularly on windows to show more details during a platform exception.

For example:

* `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` will print a short backtrace.

### `RUST_MIN_STACK`

Use to set the stack size used by uv.

The value is in bytes, and if both `UV_STACK_SIZE` are `RUST_MIN_STACK` unset, uv uses a 4MB
(4194304) stack. `UV_STACK_SIZE` takes precedence over `RUST_MIN_STACK`.

Prefer setting `UV_STACK_SIZE`, since `RUST_MIN_STACK` also affects subprocesses, such as
build backends that use Rust code.

Unlike the normal `RUST_MIN_STACK` semantics, this can affect main thread
stack size, because we actually spawn our own main2 thread to work around
the fact that Windows' real main thread is only 1MB. That thread has size
