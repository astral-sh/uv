# Windows trampolines

This is a fork of [posy trampolines](https://github.com/njsmith/posy/tree/dda22e6f90f5fefa339b869dd2bbe107f5b48448/src/trampolines/windows-trampolines/posy-trampoline).

# What is this?

Sometimes you want to run a tool on Windows that's written in Python, like
`black` or `mypy` or `jupyter` or whatever. But, Windows does not know how to
run Python files! It knows how to run `.exe` files. So we need to somehow
convert our Python file a `.exe` file.

That's what this does: it's a generic "trampoline" that lets us generate custom
`.exe`s for arbitrary Python scripts, and when invoked it bounces to invoking
`python <the script>` instead.


# How do you use it?

Basically, this looks up `python.exe` (for console programs) or
`pythonw.exe` (for GUI programs) in the adjacent directory, and invokes
`python[w].exe path\to\the\<the .exe>`.

The intended use is: take your Python script, name it `__main__.py`, and pack it
into a `.zip` file. Then concatenate that `.zip` file onto the end of one of our
prebuilt `.exe`s.

Then when you run `python` on the `.exe`, it will see the `.zip` trailer at the
end of the `.exe`, and automagically look inside to find and execute
`__main__.py`. Easy-peasy.

(TODO: we should probably make the Python-finding logic slightly more flexible
at some point -- in particular to support more conventional venv-style
installation where you find `python` by looking in the directory next to the
trampoline `.exe` -- but this is good enough to get started.)


# Why does this exist?

I probably could have used Vinay's C++ implementation from `distlib`, but what's
the fun in that? In particular, optimizing for binary size was entertaining
(these are ~7x smaller than the distlib, which doesn't matter much, but does a
little bit, considering that it gets added to every Python script). There are
also some minor advantages, like I think the Rust code is easier to understand
(multiple files!) and it's convenient to be able to straightforwardly code the
Python-finding logic we want. But mostly it was just an interesting challenge.

This does owe a *lot* to the `distlib` implementation though. The overall logic
is copied more-or-less directly.


# Anything I should know for hacking on this?

In order to minimize binary size, this uses `#![no_std]`, `panic="abort"`, and
carefully avoids using `core::fmt`. This removes a bunch of runtime overhead: by
default, Rust "hello world" on Windows is ~150 KB! So these binaries are ~10x
smaller.

Of course the tradeoff is that `#![no_std]` is an awkward super-limited
environment. No C runtime, no platform APIs, very few features... you don't even
get `Vec` or memory allocation or panicking support by default. To work around
this:

- We use `windows-sys` to access Win32 APIs directly. Who needs a C runtime?
  Though uh, this does mean that literally all of our code is `unsafe`. Sorry!

- `runtime.rs` has the core glue to get panicking, heap allocation, and linking
  working. 

- `diagnostics.rs` uses `ufmt` and some cute Windows tricks to get a convenient
  version of `eprintln!` that works without `std`, and automatically prints to
  either the console if available or pops up a message box if not.

- All the meat is in `bounce.rs`.

Miscellaneous tips:

- `cargo-bloat` is a useful tool for checking what code is ending up in the
  final binary and how much space it's taking. (It makes it very obvious whether
  you've pulled in `core::fmt`!)

- Lots of Rust built-in panicking checks will pull in `core::fmt`, e.g., if you
  ever use `.unwrap()` then suddenly our binaries double in size, because the
  `if foo.is_none() { panic!(...) }` that's hidden inside `.unwrap()` will
  invoke `core::fmt`, even if the unwrap will actually never fail.
  `.unwrap_unchecked()` avoids this. Similar for `slice[idx]` vs
  `slice.get_unchecked(idx)`.


# How do you build this stupid thing?

Building this can be frustrating, because the low-level compiler/runtime
machinery have a bunch of implicit assumptions about the environment they'll run
in, and the facilities it provides for things like `memcpy`, unwinding, etc.
With `#![no_std]` most of this machinery is missing. So we need to replace the
bits that we actually need, and which bits we need can change depending on stuff
like optimization options. For example: we use `panic="abort"`, so we don't
actually need unwinding support, but at lower optimization levels the compiler
might not realize that, and still emit references to the unwinding helper
`__CxxFrameHandler3`. And then the linker blows up because that symbol doesn't
exist.

Two approaches that are reasonably likely to work:

- Uncomment `compiler-builtins` in `Cargo.toml`, and build normally: `cargo
  build --profile release`.

- Leave `compiler-builtins` commented-out, and build like: `cargo build
  --release -Z build-std=core,panic_abort,alloc -Z
  build-std-features=compiler-builtins-mem --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
 

Hopefully in the future as `#![no_std]` develops, this will get smoother.

Also, sometimes it helps to fiddle with optimization levels.

# Cross compiling from linux

Install [cargo xwin](https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-xwin). Use your
package manager to install LLD and add the rustup targets:

```shell
sudo apt install llvm clang lld
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc
```

```shell
cargo +nightly xwin build --release -Z build-std=core,panic_abort,alloc -Z build-std-features=compiler-builtins-mem --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
cargo +nightly xwin build --release -Z build-std=core,panic_abort,alloc -Z build-std-features=compiler-builtins-mem --target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc
```
