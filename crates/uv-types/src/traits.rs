///  Avoids cyclic crate dependencies between resolver, installer and builder.
///
/// To resolve the dependencies of a packages, we may need to build one or more source
/// distributions. To building a source distribution, we need to create a virtual environment from
/// the same base python as we use for the root resolution, resolve the build requirements
/// (potentially which nested source distributions, recursing a level deeper), installing
/// them and then build. The installer, the resolver and the source distribution builder are each in
/// their own crate. To avoid circular crate dependencies, this type dispatches between the three
/// crates with its three main methods ([`BuildContext::resolve`], [`BuildContext::install`] and
/// [`BuildContext::setup_build`]).
///
/// The overall main crate structure looks like this:
///
/// ```text
