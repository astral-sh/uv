# Keyring

This is a cross-platform library that does storage and retrieval of passwords
(or other secrets) in an underlying platform-specific secure credential store.
A top-level introduction to the library's usage, as well as a small code sample,
may be found in [the library's entry on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/keyring).
Currently supported platforms are
Linux,
FreeBSD,
OpenBSD,
Windows,
macOS, and iOS.

## Design

This crate implements a very simple, platform-independent concrete object called an _entry_.
Each entry is identified by a <_service name_, _user name_> pair of UTF-8 strings.
Entries support setting, getting, and forgetting (aka deleting) passwords (UTF-8 strings)
and binary secrets (byte arrays). Each created entry provides security and persistence
of its secret by wrapping a credential held in a platform-specific, secure credential store.

The cross-platform API for creating an _entry_ supports specifying an (optional)
UTF-8 _target_ attribute on entries, but the meaning of this
attribute is credential-store (and thus platform) specific,
and should not be thought of as part of the credential's identification. See the
documentation of each credential store to understand the
effect of specifying the _target_ attribute on entries in that store,
as well as which values are allowed for _target_ by that store.

The abstract behavior of entries and credential stores are captured
by two types (with associated traits):

- a _credential builder_, represented by the [CredentialBuilder] type
  (and [CredentialBuilderApi](credential::CredentialBuilderApi) trait).  Credential
  builders are given the identifying information (and target, if any)
  provided for an entry and map
  it to the identifying information for a platform-specific credential.
- a _credential_, represented by the [Credential] type
  (and [CredentialApi](credential::CredentialApi) trait).  The platform-specific credential
  identified by the builder for an entry is what provides the secure storage
  for that entry's password/secret.

## Crate-provided Credential Stores

This crate runs on several different platforms, and on each one
it provides (by default) an implementation of a default credential store used
on that platform (see [default_credential_builder]).
These implementations work by mapping the data used to identify an entry
to data used to identify platform-specific storage objects.
For example, on macOS, the service and user provided for an entry
are mapped to the service and user attributes that identify a
generic credential in the macOS keychain.

Typically, platform-specific credential stores (called _keystores_ in this crate)
have a richer model of a credential than
the one used by this crate to identify entries.
These keystores expose their specific model in the
concrete credential objects they use to implement the Credential trait.
In order to allow clients to access this richer model, the Credential trait
has an [as_any](credential::CredentialApi::as_any) method that returns a
reference to the underlying
concrete object typed as [Any](std::any::Any), so that it can be downgraded to
its concrete type.

### Credential store features

Each of the platform-specific credential stores is associated a feature.
This feature controls whether that store is included when the crate is built
for its specific platform.  For example, the macOS Keychain credential store
implementation is only included if the `"apple-native"` feature is specified and the crate
is built with a macOS target.

The available credential store features, listed here, are all included in the
default feature set:

- `apple-native`: Provides access to the Keychain credential store on macOS and iOS.

- `windows-native`: Provides access to the Windows Credential Store on Windows.

- `secret-service`: Provides access to the DBus-based
  [Secret Service](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/latest/)
  storage on Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD.  This keystore provides
  support for encrypting secrets when they are transferred across the bus,
  specify the `encrypted` feature if you want to use this support.
  By default, this keystore requires that the DBus library be
  installed on the user's machine,
  but you can avoid this requirement by specifying the `vendored` feature
  (which will cause the build to include a static build of the dbus library).

If you suppress the default feature set when building this crate, and you
don't separately specify one of the included keystore features for your platform,
then no keystore will be built in, and calls to [Entry::new] and [Entry::new_with_target]
will fail unless the client brings their own keystore (see next section).

## Client-provided Credential Stores

In addition to the keystores implemented by this crate, clients
are free to provide their own keystores and use those.  There are
two mechanisms provided for this:

- Clients can give their desired credential builder to the crate
  for use by the [Entry::new] and [Entry::new_with_target] calls.
  This is done by making a call to [set_default_credential_builder].
  The major advantage of this approach is that client code remains
  independent of the credential builder being used.

- Clients can construct their concrete credentials directly and
  then turn them into entries by using the [Entry::new_with_credential]
  call. The major advantage of this approach is that credentials
  can be identified however clients want, rather than being restricted
  to the simple model used by this crate.

## Mock Credential Store

In addition to the platform-specific credential stores, this crate
always provides a mock credential store that clients can use to
test their code in a platform independent way.  The mock credential
store allows for pre-setting errors as well as password values to
be returned from [Entry] method calls. If you want to use the mock
credential store as your default in tests, make this call:
```
keyring::set_default_credential_builder(keyring::mock::default_credential_builder())
```

## Interoperability with Third Parties

Each of the platform-specific credential stores provided by this crate uses
an underlying store that may also be used by modules written
in other languages.  If you want to interoperate with these third party
credential writers, then you will need to understand the details of how the
target, service, and user of this crate's generic model
are used to identify credentials in the platform-specific store.
These details are in the implementation of this crate's keystores,
and are documented in the headers of those modules.

(_N.B._ Since the included credential store implementations are platform-specific,
you may need to use the Platform drop-down on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/keyring) to
view the storage module documentation for your desired platform.)

## Caveats

This module expects passwords to be UTF-8 encoded strings,
so if a third party has stored an arbitrary byte string
then retrieving that as a password will return a
[BadEncoding](Error::BadEncoding) error.
The returned error will have the raw bytes attached,
so you can access them, but you can also just fetch
them directly using [get_secret](Entry::get_secret) rather than
[get_password](Entry::get_password).

While this crate's code is thread-safe, the underlying credential
stores may not handle access from different threads reliably.
In particular, accessing the same credential
from multiple threads at the same time can fail, especially on
Windows and Linux, because the accesses may not be serialized in the same order
they are made. And for RPC-based credential stores such as the dbus-based Secret
Service, accesses from multiple threads (and even the same thread very quickly)
are not recommended, as they may cause the RPC mechanism to fail.
