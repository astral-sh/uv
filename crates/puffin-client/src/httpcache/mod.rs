/*!
A somewhat simplistic implementation of HTTP cache semantics.

This implementation was guided by the following things:

* RFCs 9110 and 9111.
* The `http-cache-semantics` crate. (The implementation here is completely
different, but the source of `http-cache-semantics` helped guide the
implementation here and understanding of HTTP caching.)
* A desire for our cache policy to support zero-copy deserialization. That
is, we want the cached response fast path (where no revalidation request is
necessary) to avoid any costly deserialization for the cache policy at all.

# Flow

While one has to read the relevant RFCs to get a full understanding of HTTP
caching, doing so is... difficult to say the least. It is at the very least
not quick to do because the semantics are scattered all over the place. But, I
think we can do a quick overview here.

Let's start with the obvious. HTTP caching exists to avoid network requests,
and, if a request is unavoidable, bandwidth. The central actor in HTTP
caching is the `Cache-Control` header, which can exist on *both* requests and
resonses. The value of this header is a list of directives that control caching
behavior. They can outright disable it (`no-store`), force cache invalidation
(`no-cache`) or even permit the cache to return responses that are explicitly
stale (`max-stale`).

The main thing that typically drives cache interactions is `max-age`. When set
on a response, this means that the server is willing to let clients hold on to
a response for up to the amount of time in `max-age` before the client must ask
the server for a fresh response. In our case, the main utility of `max-age` is
two fold:

* PyPI sets a `max-age` of 600 seconds (10 minutes) on its responses. As long
as our cached responses have an age less than this, we can completely avoid
talking to PyPI at all when we need access to the full set of versions for a
package.
* Most other assets, like wheels, are forever immutable. They will never
change. So servers will typically set a very high `max-age`, which means we
will almost never need to ask the server for permission to reuse our cached
wheel.

When a cached response exceeds the `max-age` configured on a response, then
we call that response stale. Generally speaking, we won't return responses
from the cache that are known to be stale. (This can be overridden in the
request by adding a `max-stale` cache-control directive, but nothing in uv
does this at time of writing.) When a response is stale, we don't necessarily
need to give up completely. It is at this point that we can send something
called a re-validation request.

A re-validation request includes with it some metadata (usually an "entity tag"
or `etag` for short) that was on the cached response (which is now stale).
When we send this request, the server can compare it with its most up to date
version of the resource. If its entity tag matches the one we gave it (among
other possible criteria), then the server can skip returning the body and
instead just return a small HTTP 304 NOT MODIFIED response. When we get this
type of response, it's the server telling us that our cached response which we
*thought* was stale is no longer stale. It's fresh again and we needn't get a
new copy. We will need to update our stored `CachePolicy` though, since the
HTTP 304 NOT MODIFIED response we got might included updated metadata relevant
to the behavior of caching (like a new `Age` header).

# Scope

In general, the cache semantics implemented below are targeted toward uv's
use case: a private client cache for custom data objects. This constraint
results in a modest simplification in what we need to support. That is, we
don't need to cache the entirety of the request's or response's headers (like
what `http-cache-semantics`) does. Instead, we only need to cache the data
necessary to *make decisions* about HTTP caching.

One example of this is the `Vary` response header. This requires checking the
the headers listed in a cached response have the same value in the original
request and the new request. If the new request has different values for those
headers (as specified in the cached response) than what was in the original
request, then the new request cannot used our cached response. Normally, this
would seemingly require storing all of the original request's headers. But we
only store the headers listed in the response.

Also, since we aren't a proxy, there are a host of proxy-specific rules for
managing headers and data that we needn't care about.

# Zero-copy deserialization

As mentioned above, we would really like our fast path (that is, a cached
response that we deem "fresh" and thus don't need to send a re-validation
request for) to avoid needing to actually deserialize a `CachePolicy`. While a
`CachePolicy` isn't particularly big, it is in our critical path. Yet, we still
need a `CachePolicy` to be able to decide whether a cached response is still
fresh or not. (This decision procedure is non-trivial, so it *probably* doesn't
make too much sense to hack around it with something simpler.)

We attempt to achieve this by implementing the `rkyv` traits for all of our
types. This means that if we read a `Vec<u8>` from a file, then we can very
cheaply turn that into a `rkyvutil::OwnedArchive<CachePolicy>`. Creating that
only requires a quick validation step, but is otherwise free. We can then
use that as-if it were an `Archived<CachePolicy>` (which is an alias for the
`ArchivedCachePolicy` type implicitly introduced by `derive(rkyv::Archive)`).
Crucially, this is why we implement all of our HTTP cache semantics logic on
`ArchivedCachePolicy` and *not* `CachePolicy`. It can be easy to forget this
because `rkyv` does such an amazing job of making its use of archived types
very closely resemble that of the standard types. For example, whenever the
methods below are accessing a field whose type is a `Vec` in the normal type,
what's actually being accessed is a [`rkyv::vec::ArchivedVec`]. Similarly,
for strings, it's [`rkyv::string::ArchivedString`] and not a standard library
`String`. This all works somewhat seamlessly because all of the cache semantics
are generally just read-only operations, but if you stray from the path, you're
likely to get whacked over the head.

One catch here is that we actually want the HTTP cache semantics to be
available on `CachePolicy` too. At least, at time of writing, we do. To
achieve this `CachePolicy::to_archived` is provided, which will serialize the
`CachePolicy` to its archived representation in bytes, and then turn that
into an `OwnedArchive<CachePolicy>` which derefs to `ArchivedCachePolicy`.
This is a little extra cost, but the idea is that a `CachePolicy` (not an
`ArchivedCachePolicy`) should only be used in the slower path (i.e., when you
actually need to make an HTTP request).
