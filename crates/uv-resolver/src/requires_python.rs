        //
        // When comparing, we also limit the comparison to the release segment, ignoring
        // pre-releases and such. This may or may not be correct.
        //
        // Imagine `target_lower` is `3.13.0b1`, and `requires_python_lower` is `3.13`.
        // That would be fine, since we're saying we support `3.13.0` and later, and `target_lower`
        // supports more than that.
        //
        // Next, imagine `requires_python_lower` is `3.13.0b1`, and `target_lower` is `3.13`.
        // Technically, that would _not_ be fine, since we're saying we support `3.13.0b1` and
        // later, but `target_lower` does not support that. For example, `target_lower` does not
        // support `3.13.0b1`, `3.13.0rc1`, etc.
        //
        // In practice, this is most relevant for cases like: `requires_python = "==3.8.*"`, with
        // `target = ">=3.8"`. In this case, `requires_python_lower` is actually `3.8.0.dev0`,
        // because `==3.8.*` allows development and pre-release versions. So there are versions we
        // want to support that aren't explicitly supported by `target`, which does _not_ include
        // pre-releases.
        //
        // Since this is a fairly common `Requires-Python` specifier, we handle it pragmatically
        // by only enforcing Python compatibility at the patch-release level.
        //
        // There are some potentially-bad outcomes here. For example, maybe the user _did_ request
        // `>=3.13.0b1`. In that case, maybe we _shouldn't_ allow resolution that only support
        // `3.13.0` and later, because we're saying we support the beta releases, but the dependency
        // does not. But, it's debatable.
        //
        // If this scheme proves problematic, we could explore using different semantics when
        // converting to PubGrub. For example, we could parse `==3.8.*` as `>=3.8,<3.9`. But this
        // too could be problematic. Imagine that the user requests `>=3.8.0b0`, and the target
        // declares `==3.8.*`. In this case, we _do_ want to allow resolution, because the target
        // is saying it supports all versions of `3.8`, including pre-releases. But under those
        // modified parsing semantics, we would fail. (You could argue, though, that users declaring
        // `==3.8.*` are not intending to support pre-releases, and so failing there is fine, but
        // it's also incorrect in its own way.)
        //
        // Alternatively, we could vary the semantics depending on whether or not the user included
        // a pre-release in their specifier, enforcing pre-release compatibility only if the user
        // explicitly requested it.
