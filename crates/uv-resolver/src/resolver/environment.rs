/// Represents one or more marker environments for a resolution.
///
/// Dependencies outside of the marker environments represented by this value
/// are ignored for that particular resolution.
///
/// In normal "pip"-style resolution, one resolver environment corresponds to
/// precisely one marker environment. In universal resolution, multiple marker
/// environments may be specified via a PEP 508 marker expression. In either
/// case, as mentioned above, dependencies not in these marker environments are
/// ignored for the corresponding resolution.
///
/// Callers must provide this to the resolver to indicate, broadly, what kind
/// of resolution it will produce. Generally speaking, callers should provide
/// a specific marker environment for `uv pip`-style resolutions and ask for a
/// universal resolution for uv's project based commands like `uv lock`.
///
/// Callers can rely on this type being reasonably cheap to clone.
///
/// # Internals
///
/// Inside the resolver, when doing a universal resolution, it may create
/// many "forking" states to deal with the fact that there may be multiple
/// incompatible dependency specifications. Specifically, in the Python world,
/// the main constraint is that for any one *specific* marker environment,
/// there must be only one version of a package in a corresponding resolution.
/// But when doing a universal resolution, we want to support many marker
/// environments, and in this context, the "universal" resolution may contain
/// multiple versions of the same package. This is allowed so long as, for
/// any marker environment supported by this resolution, an installation will
/// select at most one version of any given package.
///
/// During resolution, a `ResolverEnvironment` is attached to each internal
/// fork. For non-universal or "specific" resolution, there is only ever one
/// fork because a `ResolverEnvironment` corresponds to one and exactly one
/// marker environment. For universal resolution, the resolver may choose
/// to split its execution into multiple branches. Each of those branches
/// (also called "forks" or "splits") will get its own marker expression that
/// represents a set of marker environments that is guaranteed to be disjoint
/// with the marker environments described by the marker expressions of all
/// other branches.
///
/// Whether it's universal resolution or not, and whether it's one of many
/// forks or one fork, this type represents the set of possible dependency
/// specifications allowed in the resolution produced by a single fork.
///
/// An exception to this is `requires-python`. That is handled separately and
/// explicitly by the resolver. (Perhaps a future refactor can incorporate
/// `requires-python` into this type as well, but it's not totally clear at
/// time of writing if that's a good idea or not.)
