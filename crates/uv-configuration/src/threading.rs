/// Main thread stack-size has a BIG variety here across platforms and it's harder to control
/// (which is why Rust doesn't by default). Notably  on macOS and Linux you will typically get 8MB
/// main thread, while on Windows you will typically get 1MB, which is *tiny*:
/// <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/stack-stack-allocations?view=msvc-170>
///
/// To normalize this we just spawn a new thread called main2 with a size we can set
/// ourselves. 2MB is typically too small (especially for our debug builds), while 4MB
/// seems fine. This value can be changed with `UV_STACK_SIZE`, with a fallback to reading
/// `RUST_MIN_STACK`, to allow checking a larger or smaller stack size. There is a hardcoded stack
/// size minimum of 1MB, which is the lowest platform default we observed.
///
/// Non-main threads should all have 2MB, as Rust forces platform consistency there,
/// but even then stack overflows can occur in release mode
/// (<https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12769>), so rayon and tokio get the same stack size,
/// with the 4MB default.
